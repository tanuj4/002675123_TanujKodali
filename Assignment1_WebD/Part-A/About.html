            <p>Coffee is a widely consumed beverage worldwide. This is demonstrated by the growing number of coffee franchises like Starbucks and Café Coffee Day that are located all over the world.

            Coffee breaks are eagerly anticipated, especially in employment with high levels of stress, because both coffee and tea contain caffeine, which serves as a brain stimulant and promotes attentiveness.
            
            Coffee is a beverage produced from roasted coffee beans, which are typically found in powdered form in coffee pods. Arabica, Robusta, and a combination of the two are the three varieties of coffee beans. They are grown on the Indian Peninsula, South America, and several regions of Africa.
            
            Espresso, Café Latte, Macchiato, Choc Latte, and more well-known coffee drinks may have been added to the menu.</p>
